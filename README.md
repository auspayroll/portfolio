# Data Science COMP6200

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio. Herein contains three small projects that analyse datasets
from different sources through

* data transformation/cleaning if required
* data exploration
* modeling if required
* reporting and discussion/interpretation



## Getting Started

There are three seperate portfolio's, each done in seperate Jupyter notebooks. Ensure Jupyter notebooks is installed, along with Python3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries. A common scenario is to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution that have these libraries pre-installed. 

The data for each portfolio is included in the repository. 

## Portfolio 1

This is an analysis of a cyclists ride data exported from Strava, an online social network site for cycling and other sports. The dataset is a log of every ride since the start of 2018 and contains summary data like the distance and average speed.
We explore this data in attempt to identify riding patterns. 

We also attempt to identify the most popular rides from the data on the social network site. Finally we generate monthly and daily summary charts. 

## Portfolio 2

This is an analysis of the global spread of COVID-19. The data used is being made available by Johns Hopkins University. We will look at trends by country and attempt to make some comparisons with regards to cumulative confirmed caes. Finally we fit a log linear model to identify countries that have exponential transmission rates. 

## Portfolio 3

We use a set of book summaries from the CMU Book Summaries Corpus in this experiment. The goal is to correctly classify books into one of 5 genres using the meta data provided. We provide two models and provide an evaluation on how well they perform the classificaiton.
